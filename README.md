### Reflection

So I did have a bit of trouble making this whole page, the reason being I mainly used components from other activities I had done and they didn't all mesh with each other very well, some were using flexbox and some used grid. To resolve most of these problems I made certain parts all flexbox and other parts strictly grid.

Another little problem I had was finding a good color scheme to make the page look good, I honestly didn't like any of the palettes Coolors was making for me so I had to make my own.

### Flares

Hover css classes used for my navigation bar (Lines 125-126)
 - I did make a color scheme but I didn't add it in the root type of way
